'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

The palindrome can be written as:

abccba

Which then simpifies to:

100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100c + 10b + a

And then:

100001a + 10010b + 1100c

Factoring out 11, you get:
